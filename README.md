# Awesome CS PhD application advice [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
This curated list of awesome advices for computer science PhD applicants consists of blogs found on the internet, with a slightly biased emphasis on the AI/ML and NLP area. These articles greatly helped me when I was applying to Ph.D., I hope they can also help you!
